# Site Owner Goals

* To provide the user with an easy to navigate quiz game that is challenging whilst also not extensively time consuming.
* To present the user with a website that is visually appealing and fully responsive.
* To allow the user to test their general knowledge against a selection of randomly selected questions.
* To present the user with a quick thinking challenge whilst also not being too restricting.
* To tempt the user to come back and try again to get further and further along. 

# User Stories

## User Goals

### First Time User

* As a first time user I want to understand the main purpose of the quiz.
* As a first time user I want to be able to naavigate the quiz, understand the concept of the quiz, see how far I can get and restart the quiz should I fail.
* As a first time user I want to have fun and also expand my general knowledge.
  
### Returning User

* As a returning user I want to be able to play the same quiz and still enjoy it as much as the first time.
* As a returning user I want to be able to get further than the first time I attempted the quiz.

### Other considerable goals (not in the working example but ideas of how to expand/make the quiz better)

* Allow first time users to select a subsection of the quiz for something they enjoy more than a general quiz.
* Allow first time users to choose a mode of difficulty for the question bank.
* Allow the ability for first time/returning users to choose how long they want on the timer.
* Starting the quiz from a completely random point, and subsequent questions will be random, so the user won't do the quiz in the same order.
* Tracking the time it takes people to do the quiz. (Completions only)
* Having a local/non-local leaderboard to compare scores and see who did the quiz in the fastest time.

# Design

## Imagery

* The colour scheme of the site was given careful consideration. The colours used in the quiz is important to the overall experience of the user.
